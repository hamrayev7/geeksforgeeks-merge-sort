# geeksforgeeks-merge-sort
Efficient Python implementation of Merge Sort, a stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity. This repository includes well-documented code for splitting arrays, recursively sorting subarrays, and merging them back. Ideal for understanding core sorting techniques and comparing with other algorithms.
